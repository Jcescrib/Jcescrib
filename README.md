# 👋 Hi, I'm Joan Cepero Escribano

🎓 **Business Analyst & Process Engineer** transitioning into full-stack development  
🔁 From strategy to code — passionate about automation, AI, and building real-world solutions

I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Big Data & Data Analysis. I am passionate about applying automation and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I’ve worked with time series forecasting models for price prediction and built low-code automations using n8n.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on...

- Updating and organizing my GitHub profile to showcase past and ongoing projects  
- Documenting applied projects involving forecasting, data automation, and low-code tools  
- Developing AI-powered tools and chatbots, including early experiments with agent-based systems


## 🌱 I’m currently learning...

- Full-stack development with a focus on Python backend and API integration  
- Low-code orchestration using n8n, including agent-based automation techniques  
- Software engineering best practices: clean code, testing, version control with Git

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on...


- Lightweight AI and automation tools for everyday productivity and workflow enhancement  
- Open-source automation pipelines for data collection, processing, and notifications  
- Backend tools for data transformation, reporting, and KPI tracking  
- Data analysis projects focused on extracting actionable insights  
- Process analysis and optimization initiatives across business domains

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I’ve worked as a researcher, engineer, process analyst, consultant, and project manager—across Spain, Norway, and Peru. I speak Spanish, Catalan, and English, and I'm an enthusiast of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, public speaking, and philosophy.
